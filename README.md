Project-Gallery

This is a simple project gallery to display projects I complete.

This project has helped me to learn:

Flexbox 
Javascript syntax
JSON files and using data from JSON to manipulate the DOM
using a loop in code to repeat an action

I also researched latest trends in website layouts and best practice
